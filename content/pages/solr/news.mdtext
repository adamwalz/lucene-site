# Solr<sup>&trade;</sup> News

## 14 August 2019, [ANNOUNCE] 8.1.1 and 8.2.0 users check ENABLE_REMOTE_JMX_OPTS setting

    Severity: Low

    Versions Affected:
    8.1.1 and 8.2.0 for Linux

    Description:
    It has been discovered [1] that the 8.1.1 and 8.2.0 releases contain a bad default 
    setting for the ENABLE_REMOTE_JMX_OPTS setting in the default solr.in.sh file
    shipping with Solr.
    
    Windows users and users with custom solr.in.sh files are not affected.
    
    If you are using the default solr.in.sh file from the affected releases, then
    JMX monitoring will be enabled and exposed on JMX_PORT (default = 18983),
    without any authentication. So if your firewalls allows inbound traffic on 
    JMX_PORT, then anyone with network access to your Solr nodes will be able to 
    access monitoring data exposed over JMX.
    
    Mitigation:
    Edit solr.in.sh, set ENABLE_REMOTE_JMX_OPTS=false and restart Solr.
    Alternatively wait for the future 8.3.0 release and upgrade.

Apache Lucene project. Its major features include powerful full-text search,
hit highlighting, faceted search, dynamic clustering, database integration, rich document
(e.g., Word, PDF) handling, and geospatial search. Solr is highly scalable, providing fault

  <http://lucene.apache.org/solr/downloads.html>

Please read CHANGES.txt for a full list of new features and changes:

  <http://lucene.apache.org/solr/8_0_0/changes/Changes.html>

### Solr 8.0.0 Release Highlights

* Solr now uses HTTP/2 for inter-node communication to attain greater efficiency.  
Details:  Solr is switching from Apache HttpClient to Jetty Client for adding HTTP/2 support.
Most frequent inter-communication between nodes like indexing and query are now sent in HTTP/2.
HTTP/1.1 practically allows only one outstanding request per TCP connection this means that for sending multiple requests at the same time multiple TCP connections must be established.
This leads to waste of resources on both-sides and long GC-pause.
Solr 8 with HTTP/2 support overcomes that problem by allowing multiple requests can be sent in parallel using a same TCP connection.

* Nested documents (AKA child documents or block join) is significantly improved.
Most improvements come from storing and leveraging more information about the relationships in the index, like the named relationship between a child and its parent.
This information is used by the [child] doc transformer to return children in nested form instead of flat.
There is plenty more that can be done with this in the future.
Another key improvement is that nested documents can be deleted or replaced in a natural way without orphaning child documents; although care is still needed with delete-by-query.

Being a major release, Solr 8 removes many deprecated APIs, changes various parameter defaults and behavior. Some changes may require a re-index of your content.
You are thus encouraged to thoroughly read the "Upgrade Notes" at:

  <http://lucene.apache.org/solr/8_0_0/changes/Changes.html>

Solr 8.0 also includes many other new features as well as numerous optimizations and bugfixes of the corresponding Apache Lucene release:

Apache Lucene project. Its major features include powerful full-text search,
hit highlighting, faceted search, dynamic clustering, database integration, rich document
(e.g., Word, PDF) handling, and geospatial search. Solr is highly scalable, providing fault

### Solr 7.7.1 Release Highlights:

 * Bugfix for ClassCastException when URPs try to read a String field which returns a ByteArrayUTF8CHarSequence (a
   regression in release 7.7.0).

 * Bugfix: Autoscaling based replica placement was broken out of the box. Solr 7.6 enabled autoscaling based replica
   placement by default but in the absence of default cluster policies, autoscaling can place more than 1 replica of the
   same shard on the same node. Also, the maxShardsPerNode and createNodeSet was not respected. Due to these reasons,
   this issue reverts the default replica placement policy to the 'legacy' assignment policy that was the default until
   Solr 7.5.

## 12 October 2017, Please secure your Apache Solr servers since a zero-day exploit has been reported on a public mailing list

Please secure your Solr servers since a zero-day exploit has been
reported on a [public mailing list](https://s.apache.org/FJDl).
This has been assigned a public CVE (CVE-2017-12629) which we
will reference in future communication about resolution and mitigation
steps.

Here is what we're recommending and what we're doing now:

* Until fixes are available, all Solr users are advised to restart their
Solr instances with the system property `-Ddisable.configEdit=true`.
This will disallow any changes to be made to configurations via the
Config API. This is a key factor in this vulnerability, since it allows
GET requests to add the RunExecutableListener to the config. This is
sufficient to protect you from this type of attack, but means you cannot
use the edit capabilities of the Config API until the other fixes
described below are in place. Users are also advised to remap
the XML Query Parser to another parser to mitigate the XXE
vulnerability. For example, adding the following to the solrconfig.xml
file maps the `xmlparser` to the `edismax` parser:
`<queryParser name="xmlparser" class="solr.ExtendedDismaxQParserPlugin"/>`.

* A new release of Lucene/Solr was in the vote phase, but we have now
pulled it back to be able to address these issues in the upcoming 7.1
release. We will also determine mitigation steps for users on earlier
versions, which may include a 6.6.2 release for users still on 6.x.

* The RunExecutableListener will be removed in 7.1. It was previously
used by Solr for index replication but has been replaced and is no
longer needed.

* The XML Parser will be fixed and the fixes will be included in the 7.1
release.

* The 7.1 release was already slated to include a change to disable the
`stream.body` parameter by default, which will further help protect
systems.

## 20 September 2017, Apache Solr™ 7.0.0 available

The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Solr 7.0.0

Solr is the popular, blazing fast, open source NoSQL search platform from the
Apache Lucene project. Its major features include powerful full-text search,
hit highlighting, faceted search and analytics, rich document parsing,
geospatial search, extensive REST APIs as well as parallel SQL. Solr is
enterprise grade, secure and highly scalable, providing fault tolerant
distributed search and indexing, and powers the search and navigation features
of many of the world's largest internet sites.

Solr 7.0.0 is available for immediate download at:
<http://lucene.apache.org/solr/mirrors-solr-latest-redir.html>

### Highlights for this Solr release include:

* Replica Types - Solr 7 supports different replica types, which handle updates differently. In addition to pure NRT operation where all replicas build an index and keep a replication log, you can now also add so called PULL replicas, achieving the read-speed optimized benefits of a master/slave setup while at the same time keeping index redundancy.

* Auto-scaling. Solr can now allocate new replicas to nodes using a new auto scaling policy framework. This framework will in future releases enable Solr to move shards around based on load, disk etc.

* Indented JSON is now the default response format for all APIs, pass wt=xml and/or indent=off to use the previous unindented XML format.

* The JSON Facet API now supports two-phase facet refinement to ensure accurate counts and statistics for facet buckets returned in distributed mode.

* Streaming Expressions adds a new statistical programming syntax for the statistical analysis of sql queries, random samples, time series and graph result sets.

* Analytics Component version 2.0, which now supports distributed collections, expressions over multivalued fields, a new JSON request language, and more.

* The new v2 API, exposed at /api/ and also supported via SolrJ, is now the preferred API, but /solr/ continues to work.

* A new '_default' configset is used if no config is specified at collection creation. The data-driven functionality of this configset indexes strings as analyzed text while at the same time copying to a '*_str' field suitable for faceting.

* Solr 7 is tested with and verified to support Java 9.

## 18 September 2017, [SECURITY] - CVE-2017-9803

**CVE-2017-9803: Security vulnerability in kerberos delegation token functionality**

**Severity**: Important

**Vendor**:
The Apache Software Foundation

**Versions Affected**:
Solr 6.2.0 to 6.6.0

**Description**:

Solr's Kerberos plugin can be configured to use delegation tokens, which allows an application to reuse the authentication of an end-user or another application.
There are two issues with this functionality (when using SecurityAwareZkACLProvider type of ACL provider e.g. SaslZkACLProvider),

Firstly, access to the security configuration can be leaked to users other than the solr super user. Secondly, malicious users can exploit this leaked configuration for privilege escalation to further expose/modify private data and/or disrupt operations in the Solr cluster.

The vulnerability is fixed from Solr 6.6.1 onwards.

**Mitigation**:
6.x users should upgrade to 6.6.1

**Credit**:
This issue was discovered by Hrishikesh Gadre of Cloudera Inc.

Apache Lucene project. Its major features include powerful full-text search,
hit highlighting, faceted search and analytics, rich document parsing,
geospatial search, extensive REST APIs as well as parallel SQL. Solr is
enterprise grade, secure and highly scalable, providing fault tolerant
distributed search and indexing, and powers the search and navigation features
of many of the world's largest internet sites.

Solr 6.6.1 is available for immediate download at:
<http://lucene.apache.org/solr/mirrors-solr-latest-redir.html>

This release includes 15 bug fixes since the 6.6.0 release. Some of the major fixes are:

* Standalone Solr loads UNLOADed core on request

* ParallelStream should set the StreamContext when constructing SolrStreams

* CloudSolrStream.toExpression incorrectly handles fq clauses

* CoreContainer.load needs to send lazily loaded core descriptors to the proper list rather than send them all to the transient lists

* Creating a core should write a core.properties file first and clean up on failure

* Clean up a few details left over from pluggable transient core and untangling

* Provide a way to know when Core Discovery is finished and when all async cores are done loading

* CDCR bootstrapping can get into an infinite loop when a core is reloaded

* SolrJmxReporter is broken on core reload. This resulted in some or most metrics not being reported via JMX after core reloads, depending on timing

* Creating a core.properties fails if the parent of core.properties is a symlinked directory

* StreamHandler should allow connections to be closed early

* Certain admin UI pages would not load up correctly with kerberos enabled

* Fix DOWNNODE -> queue-work znode explosion in ZooKeeper

* Upgrade to Hadoop 2.7.4 to fix incompatibility with Java 9

* Fix bin/solr.cmd so it can run properly on Java 9

## 7 July 2017 - [SECURITY] CVE-2017-7660

**CVE-2017-7660: Security Vulnerability in secure inter-node communication in Apache Solr**

**Severity**: Important

**Vendor**:
The Apache Software Foundation

**Versions Affected**:
Solr 5.3 to 5.5.4
Solr 6.0 to 6.5.1

**Description:**

Solr uses a PKI based mechanism to secure inter-node communication
when security is enabled. It is possible to create a specially crafted
node name that does not exist as part of the cluster and point it to a
malicious node. This can trick the nodes in cluster to believe that
the malicious node is a member of the cluster. So, if Solr users have
enabled BasicAuth authentication mechanism using the BasicAuthPlugin
or if the user has implemented a custom Authentication plugin, which
does not implement either "HttpClientInterceptorPlugin" or
"HttpClientBuilderPlugin", his/her servers are vulnerable to this
attack. Users who only use SSL without basic authentication or those
who use Kerberos are not affected.

**Mitigation**:

 - 6.x users should upgrade to 6.6.0 or higher
 - 5.x users should obtain the latest source from git and apply this patch:
<http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene-solr/commit/2f5ecbcf>

## 15 February 2017 - [SECURITY] CVE-2017-3163
CVE-2017-3163: Apache Solr ReplicationHandler path traversal attack

**Severity:** Moderate

**Vendor:**
The Apache Software Foundation

**Versions Affected:**
Solr 1.4 to 6.4.0

**Description:**
When using the Index Replication feature, Solr nodes can pull index files from
a master/leader node using an HTTP API which accepts a file name. However,
Solr did not validate the file name, hence it was possible to craft a special
request involving path traversal, leaving any file readable to the Solr server
process exposed. Solr servers protected and restricted by firewall rules
and/or authentication would not be at risk since only trusted clients and users
would gain direct HTTP access.

**Mitigation:**

* 6.x users should upgrade to 6.4.1
* 5.x users should upgrade to 5.5.4
* 4.x, 3.x and 1.4 users should upgrade to a supported version of Solr
or setup proper firewalling, or disable the ReplicationHandler if not in use.

  * The new config parameter 'maxRamMB'can now limit the memory consumed by the FastLRUCache

  * A new document processor 'SkipExistingDocumentsProcessor' that skips duplicate inserts and ignores updates to missing docs

  * FieldCache information fetched via the mbeans handler or seen via the UI now displays the total size used.

  * A new config flag 'enable' allows to enable/disable any cache

Please note, this release cannot be built from source with Java 8 update 121,
use an earlier version instead! This is caused by a bug introduced into the
Javadocs tool shipped with that update. The workaround was too late for this
Lucene release. Of course, you can use the binary artifacts.

## 16 November 2016 - Apache Solr Reference Guide for 6.3 Available

The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce that the Solr Reference Guide
for Solr 6.3 has been released.

This 736-page PDF is the definitive guide to using Apache Solr. It can be
downloaded from:

## 8 November 2016 - Apache Solr™ 6.3.0 Available

The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Solr 6.3.0.

Solr is the popular, blazing fast, open source NoSQL search platform
from the Apache Lucene project. Its major features include powerful
full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search and analytics,
rich document parsing, geospatial search, extensive REST APIs as well
as parallel SQL. Solr is enterprise grade, secure and highly scalable,
providing fault tolerant distributed search and indexing, and powers
the search and navigation features of many of the world's largest
internet sites.

Solr 6.3.0 is available for immediate download at:
<http://lucene.apache.org/solr/mirrors-solr-latest-redir.html>

### Highlights of this Solr release include:

DocValues, streaming, /export, machine learning

  * Optimize, store and deploy AI models in Solr

  * Ability to add custom streaming expressions

  * New streaming expressions such as "fetch", "executor", and "commit" added.

  * Parallel SQL accepts <, >, =, etc., symbols.

  * Support facet scoring with the scoreNodes expression

  * Retrieving docValues as stored values was sped up by using the proper leaf reader rather than ask for a global view.  In extreme cases, this leads to a 100x speedup.

Faceting:

  * facet.method=enum can bypass exact counts calculation with facet.exists=true, it just returns 1 for terms which exists in result docset

  * Add "overrequest" parameter to JSON Facet API to control amount of overrequest  on a distributed terms facet

Logging:

  * You can now set Solr's log level through environment variable SOLR_LOG_LEVEL

  * GC logs are rotated by JVM to a max of 9 files, and backed up via bin/solr scripts

  * Solr's logging verbosity at the INFO level has been greatly reduced by moving much logging to DEBUG level

  * The solr-8983-console.log file now only logs STDOUT and STDERR output, not all log4j logs as before

  * Solr's main log file, solr.log, is now written to SOLR_LOGS_DIR without changing log4j.properties

Start scripts:

  * Allow 180 seconds for shutdown before killing solr (configurable, old limit 5s) (Unix only)

  * Start scripts now exits with informative message if using wrong Java version

  * Fixed "bin/solr.cmd zk upconfig" command which was broken on windows

  * You can now ask for DEBUG logging simply with '-v' option, and for WARN logging with '-q' option

SolrCloud:

  * The DELETEREPLICA API can accept a 'count' parameter and remove "count" number of replicas from each shard if the shard name is not provided

  * The config API shows expanded useParams for request handlers inline

  * Ability to create/delete/list snapshots at collection level

  * The modify collection API now waits for the modified properties to show up in the cluster state before returning

  * Many bug fixes related to SolrCloud recovery for data safety and faster recovery times.

Security:

  * SolrJ now supports Kerberos delegation tokens

  * Pooled SSL connections were not being re-used. This is now fixed.

  * Fix for the blockUnknown property which made inter-node communication impossible

  * Support SOLR_AUTHENTICATION_OPTS and SOLR_AUTHENTICATION_CLIENT_CONFIGURER in windows bin/solr.cmd script

  * New parameter -u <user:pass> in bin/post to pass basicauth credentials

Misc changes:

  * Optimizations to lower memory allocations when indexing JSON as well as for replication between solr cloud nodes.

  * A new Excel workbook (.xlsx) response writer has been added. Use 'wt=xlsx' request parameter on a query request to enable.

## 8 February 2016 - Apache Lucene/Solr development moves to GIT

As of January 23rd 2016, Lucene/Solr source code is hosted in Apache's GIT repository.
This means that the old SVN repository is now stale and should not be used.
For information on working with git, please consult
[the Solr web site](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/resources.html#solr-version-control)
and the [wiki](https://wiki.apache.org/solr/Git%20commit%20process).

The [GitHub mirror](https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/) remains at
the same location as before, but the contents have changed. We now have
one unified repo preserving the full history of both Lucene and Solr.
If you had a GitHub fork, you will find
that it has changed its "forked from" location, and any Pull Request will go to
that other fork instead of to the Lucene developers. The only known solution is to
delete your existing fork and re-fork from [GitHub](https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/).

If you had active code changes and Pull Requests against our old GitHub mirror,
please see [the wiki](https://wiki.apache.org/solr/HowToContribute#Working_with_GitHub)
for some suggestions on how to proceed.

The PMC is happy to answer any question you may have regarding this change.

    * unique() is now implemented for numeric and date fields
    * Optional flatter form via a "type" parameter
    * Added support for "mincount" parameter in range facets to suppress buckets less than that count

    * hll() facet function for distributed cardinality via HyperLogLog algorithm.
    See examples at http://yonik.com/solr-count-distinct/

* A new "facet.range.method" parameter to let users choose how to do range faceting between an implementation based on filters (previous algorithm, using "facet.range.method=filter") or DocValues ("facet.range.method=dv")

* Rule-based Replica assignment during collection, shard, and replica creation.

* Stats component:
    * New 'cardinality' option for stats.field, uses HyperLogLog to efficiently estimate the cardinality of a field w/bounded RAM. Blog post: https://lucidworks.com/blog/hyperloglog-field-value-cardinality-stats/
    * stats.field now supports individual local params for 'countDistinct' and 'distinctValues'. 'calcdistinct' is still supported as an alias for both options.

* HDFS transaction log replication factor is now configurable

* A cluster-wide property can now be be added/edited/deleted using the zkcli script and doesn't require a running Solr instance.

* New spatial RptWithGeometrySpatialField, based on CompositeSpatialStrategy, which blends RPT indexes for speed with serialized geometry for accuracy.  Includes a Lucene segment based in-memory shape cache.

* Refactored Admin UI using AngularJS. It isn't the default, but a parallel UI interface in this release.

## 18 August 2014 - Recommendation to update Apache POI in Apache Solr 4.8.0, 4.8.1, and 4.9.0 installations

Apache Solr versions 4.8.0, 4.8.1, 4.9.0 bundle Apache POI 3.10-beta2 with its binary release tarball.
This version (and all previous ones) of Apache POI are vulnerable to the following issues:

### CVE-2014-3529: XML External Entity (XXE) problem in Apache POI's OpenXML parser

*Information disclosure:* Apache POI uses Java's XML components to parse OpenXML files produced by Microsoft Office products (DOCX, XLSX, PPTX,...).
Applications that accept such files from end-users are vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks, which allows remote attackers to bypass
security restrictions and read arbitrary files via a crafted OpenXML document that provides an XML external entity declaration in conjunction
with an entity reference.

### CVE-2014-3574: XML Entity Expansion (XEE) problem in Apache POI's OpenXML parser

*Denial of service:* Apache POI uses Java's XML components and Apache Xmlbeans to parse OpenXML files produced by Microsoft Office products
(DOCX, XLSX, PPTX,...). Applications that accept such files from end-users are vulnerable to XML Entity Expansion (XEE) attacks ("XML bombs"),
which allows remote hackers to consume large amounts of CPU resources.

**The Apache POI PMC released a bugfix version (3.10.1) today.**

Solr users are affected by these issues, if they enable the "Apache Solr Content Extraction Library (Solr Cell)"
contrib module from the folder "contrib/extraction" of the release tarball.

Users of Apache Solr are strongly advised to keep the module disabled if they don't use it.
Alternatively, users of Apache Solr 4.8.0, 4.8.1, or 4.9.0 can update the affected libraries by
replacing the vulnerable JAR files in the distribution folder. Users of previous versions have
to update their Solr release first, patching older versions is impossible.

### To replace the vulnerable JAR files follow these steps:

* Download the [Apache POI 3.10.1](http://poi.apache.org/download.html#POI-3.10.1) binary release.

* Unzip the archive.

* Delete the following files in your "solr-4.X.X/contrib/extraction/lib" folder:
    * poi-3.10-beta2.jar
    * poi-ooxml-3.10-beta2.jar
    * poi-ooxml-schemas-3.10-beta2.jar
    * poi-scratchpad-3.10-beta2.jar
    * xmlbeans-2.3.0.jar

* Copy the following files from the base folder of the Apache POI distribution to the "solr-4.X.X/contrib/extraction/lib" folder:
    * poi-3.10.1-20140818.jar
    * poi-ooxml-3.10.1-20140818.jar
    * poi-ooxml-schemas-3.10.1-20140818.jar
    * poi-scratchpad-3.10.1-20140818.jar

* Copy "xmlbeans-2.6.0.jar" from POI's "ooxml-lib/" folder to the "solr-4.X.X/contrib/extraction/lib" folder.

* Verify that the "solr-4.X.X/contrib/extraction/lib" no longer contains any files with version number "3.10-beta2".

* Verify that the folder contains one xmlbeans JAR file with version 2.6.0.

If you just want to disable extraction of Microsoft Office documents, delete the files above and don't replace them.
"Solr Cell" will automatically detect this and disable Microsoft Office document extraction.

Coming versions of Apache Solr will have the updated libraries bundled.

## 12 March 2014 - Apache Solr 4.8 will require Java 7

The Apache Solr committers decided with a large majority on the vote to require **Java 7** for the next minor release of Apache Solr (version 4.8)!

The next release will also contain some improvements for Java 7:

* Better file handling (especially on Windows) in the directory implementations. Files can now be deleted on windows, although the index is still open - like it was always possible on Unix environments (delete on last close semantics).

* Speed improvements in sorting comparators: Sorting now uses Java 7's own comparators for integer and long sorts, which are highly optimized by the Hotspot VM.

If you want to stay up-to-date with Lucene and Solr, you should upgrade your infrastructure to Java 7.
Please be aware that you must use at least use Java 7u1.
The recommended version at the moment is Java 7u25. Later versions like 7u40, 7u45,... have a bug causing index corrumption.
Ideally use the Java 7u60 prerelease, which has fixed this bug. Once 7u60 is out, this will be the recommended version.
In addition, there is no more Oracle/BEA JRockit available for Java 7, use the official Oracle Java 7.
JRockit was never working correctly with Lucene/Solr (causing index corrumption), so this should not be an issue.
Please also review our list of JVM bugs: <http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/JavaBugs>

*EDIT (as of 15 April 2014):* The recently released Java 7u55 fixes the above bug causing index corrumption.
This version is now the recommended version for running Apache Solr.

## 25 June 2009 - Apache Open Relevance Kickoff
The Apache Lucene PMC has officially voted to add the Open Relevance Project (ORP) as a Lucene subproject. ORP's main goal is to build out collections,
judgments and queries in an open environment to make it easier for Lucene developers and users to do relevance testing, much like
one would get if using TREC or other evaluation conferences.

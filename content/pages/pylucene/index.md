## What is PyLucene ?

PyLucene is a [Python](https://www.python.org) extension for accessing Java
[Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/java/)
<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: xx-small">TM</span>. Its goal
is to allow you to use Lucene's text indexing and searching capabilities from
Python. It is API compatible with the latest version of Java Lucene, version
8.1.1 as of September 11th, 2019.

PyLucene is not a Lucene port but a Python wrapper around Java Lucene. PyLucene
embeds a Java VM with Lucene into a Python process. The PyLucene Python extension,
a Python module called **lucene** is machine-generated by JCC.

PyLucene is built with [JCC](jcc/index.html), a C++ code generator that makes it
possible to call into Java classes from Python via Java's Native Invocation
Interface (JNI). Sources for JCC are included with the PyLucene sources.

See [here](features.html) for more information and documentation about PyLucene.

## Requirements

PyLucene is supported on macOS, Linux, Solaris and Windows.

PyLucene requires Python version 2.x (x >= 3.5) or Python 3.x (x >= 3) and Java
version 1.8. Building PyLucene requires GNU Make, a recent version of
[Ant](https://ant.apache.org) capable of building Java
[Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/java/) and a C++ compiler. Use of
[setuptools](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools) is recommended.

See the JCC [installation](jcc/install.html) instructions for more information
about building JCC from sources.

See the PyLucene [installation instructions](install.html) for more information
about building PyLucene from sources.

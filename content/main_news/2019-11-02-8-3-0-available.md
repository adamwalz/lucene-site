Title: Apache Lucene 8.3.0 and Apache Solr 8.3.0 available

The Lucene PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache® Lucene™ 8.3.0 and Apache® Solr™ 8.3.0.

Lucene can be downloaded from <https://lucene.apache.org/core/downloads.html>
and Solr can be downloaded from <https://lucene.apache.org/solr/downloads.html>

### Highlights of this Lucene release include:

  * New SpanishMinimalStemFilter
  * New "export all terms and doc freqs" feature to Luke with delimiters
  * Composite Matches from multiple subqueries now allow access to their submatches, and a new NamedMatches API allows marking of subqueries and a simple way to find which subqueries have matched on a given
  * Range Query For Multiple Connected Ranges
  * LatLonDocValuesPointInPolygonQuery for LatLonDocValuesField
  * New UniformSplitPostingsFormat (name "UniformSplit") primarily benefiting in simplicity and extensibility
  * New STUniformSplitPostingsFormat (name "SharedTermsUniformSplit") that shares a single internal term dictionary across fields
  * DisjunctionMaxQuery more efficiently leverages impacts to skip non-competitive hits
  * BooleanQuery with no scoring clause can now early terminate the query when the total hits is not requested
  * Matches on wildcard queries will defer building their full disjunction until a MatchesIterator is pulled
  * spatial-extras quad and packed quad prefix trees now index points faster
  * Add additional leaf node level optimizations in LatLonShapeBoundingBoxQuery
  * Improve performance of WITHIN and DISJOINT queries for Shape queries by doing just one pass whenever possible
  * Introduce shared count based early termination across multiple slices
  * Blocktree's seekExact now short-circuits false if the term isn't in the min-max range of the segment. Large perf gain for ID/time like data when populated sequentially
  * Show SPI names instead of class names in Luke Analysis tab
  * GraphTokenStreamFiniteStrings preserves all Token attributes through its finite strings TokenStreams
  * Introduced SpanPositionRange into XML Query Parser
  * Use a sort key instead of true distance in NearestNeighbor
  * Tessellator labels the edges of the generated triangles whether they belong to the original polygon
  * Use exact distance between point and bounding rectangle in FloatPointNearestNeighbor
  * The Korean analyzer now splits tokens on boundaries between digits and alphabetic characters
  * MoreLikeThis is biased for uncommon fields


### Highlights of this Solr release include:

  * Two dimensional routed aliases are now available for organizing collections based on the data values of two fields
  * SPLITSHARD implements a new splitByPrefix option that takes into account the actual document distribution when using compositeIds
  * QueryElevationComponent can have query rules configured with match="subset" wherein the words need only match a subset of the query's words and in any order
  * Command line option to export documents to a file
  * Support deterministic replica routing preferences for better cache usage
  * Ability to query aliases in Solr Admin UI
  * JWTAuthPlugin supports multiple JWKS endpoints and multiple IdP issuers
  * JSON faceting now supports arbitrary ranges for range facets
  * Support integral plots, cosine distance and string truncation with math expressions (Joel Bernstein)
  * New cat() stream source to create tuples from lines in local files
  * Add upper, lower, trim and split Stream Evaluators
  * Add CsvStream, TsvStream Streaming Expressions and supporting Stream Evaluators
  * Add CaffeineCache, an efficient implementation of SolrCache
  * Live SPLITSHARD can lose updates due to cluster state change between checking if the current shard is active and later checking if there are any sub-shard leaders to forward the update to
  * Fix for SPLITSHARD (async) with failures in underlying sub-operations can result in data loss
  * Allow dynamic resizing of SolrCache-s
  * Allow optional redaction of data saved by 'bin/solr autoscaling -save'
  * Optimized large managed schema modifications (internal O(n^2) problem)
  * Max idle time support for SolrCache implementations
  * Add Prometheus Exporter GC and Heap options
  * SSL: Adding Enabling/Disabling client's hostname verification config
  * Introducing SolrClient.ping(collection) in SolrJ
  * Fix for CDCR bootstrap not replicating index to the replicas of target cluster
  * Fixed a race condition when initializing metrics for new security plugins on security.json change
  * Fixed JWTAuthPlugin to update metrics prior to continuing w/other filters or returning error
  * Fixed distributed grouping when multiple 'fl' params are specified
  * JMX MBeans are not exposed because of race condition between creating platform mbean server and registering mbeans
  * Fix for class-cast issues during atomic-update 'removeregex' operations
  * Fix for multi-node race condition to create/remove nodeLost markers
  * Fix for too many cascading calls to remote servers, which can bring down nodes
  * Fix for MOVEREPLICA ignoring replica type and always adding 'nrt' replicas
  * Fix: DistributedZkUpdateProcessor should propagate URP.finish() lifecycle (regression since 8.1)
